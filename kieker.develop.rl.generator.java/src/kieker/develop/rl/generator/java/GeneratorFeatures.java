package kieker.develop.rl.generator.java;

/**
 * This class lists all features of the generator for specific
 * Kieker target versions. The version name pattern is
 * major.minor.release-suffix
 * where major is compulsory, other values are optional.
 * The values for major, minor and release are integer values, where
 * suffix can be any string. A missing minor or release is automatically
 * substituted for 0.
 * Furthermore, the range values are always included, e.g.,
 * 1.0:1.2 includes all version form 1.0.0 to 1.2.0. That includes
 * 1.0.1, 1.0.2, 1.1, ... up until 1.2, 1.2.0, but not 1.2.1 or later.
